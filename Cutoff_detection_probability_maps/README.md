This folder contains the spectral cutoff detection maps, computed with gammapy assuming 10h of observation time.

The `1D` and `3D` folders both contain:
- a .png file showing the maps
- a .txt file with the data.

Each .txt file contains 4 column.
- First column: Flux norm at 1 TeV (mCrab) of the simulated source
- Second column: Spectral index (negative values, e.g. -1.7) of the simulated source
- Third colun: Spectral cutoff of the simulated source (TeV)
- Fourth column: Cutoff detection probability (between 0 and 1)
