Each folder corresponds to a different set of injected source parameters. The naming scheme is:

        {norm at 1 TeV}_{spectral index}_{cutoff energy [TeV]}.
        
Each folder contains 4 text files. Each text file contains a column of values, that correspond to the reconstraucted parameters (and TS) for the 100 simulations that I run in each case.
